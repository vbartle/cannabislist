We are adding a Mobile Account Consultant (MAC) to our team of cannabis experts. The role is a hybrid of the delivery driver and customer service responsibilities. Our MAC’s are the main source of interaction with our accounts and what makes VCC Brands a standout from other services. We pride ourselves as the number one customer service-oriented cannabis brand in California.

About VCC Brands

Our company is a pioneer in the medical cannabis industry, creating the first cannabis brand that embraces Californian values and a small farmer ecosystem. VCC Brands creates a world where cannabis is consumed in a spirit of wellness, freedom and fun. We are committed to collaborating with other industry leaders, researchers, regulators and policy makers to create a thriving cannabis industry that benefits everyone. We make all of our products with whole plant extracts from sustainable sun-grown cannabis and lab test every batch to ensure consistent potency and patient safety. Our values are simple; respect for all, cherish the land, and radiate positive energy.

Why Join VCC Brands?

You’ve probably heard cannabis will be a $40+ billion industry by as early as 2020. While it is no doubt there is enormous market potential, more importantly, the VCC Brands team sees an incredible opportunity to shape the future of an entire industry.

Through a values-driven approach and a regulated market, we have the chance to break down prohibition stigmas to show that cannabis can play an emerging role in treating many common medical conditions, as well as provide important tax and societal benefits. We also believe in the opportunity to build an agricultural model centered around small, independent farmers which could be replicated around the world. If this gets you excited, too, we encourage you to inquire about a career with VCC Brands.
